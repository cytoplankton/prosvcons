prosvcons
=========

Summary
-------
A tool to create lists and compare the pros and cons of your predicament.
Learning NodeJS, Express, Stylus, Jade, MongoDB, Bootstrap, AngularJS - frustratingly all at once.  A who's who 
of webdev buzz words.  


To-do
-----
- Add weighting logic
- When saving, save the pros and cons
- Fill out Contact page
- Fill out About page
- Clicking on a saved list from the top dropdown to load the list
- Add a Delete button next to Save, to delete saved lists
- User creation/authentication so everyone has their own lists
- Refactor the Angular controller to be more modular.  Duplicate code for pros and cons is no good.
